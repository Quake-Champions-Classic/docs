        <h2 id="v12">Version 12</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Gordon Freeman.</li>
            <li>New Map: The Vale of Pnath. Supports Deathmatch and Horde Mode.</li>
            <li>New music: "The Netherworld" (track34.ogg) Based off of Andrew Hulshult's "Ithagnal" track in Quake Champions.</li>
            <li>Add <i>skin</i> property to <i>qcc_prop_dynamic</i> in <i>qcc.fgd</i>.</li>
            <li>Add <i>wait</i> property to <i>trigger_counter</i> in <i>qcc.fgd</i>. <i>Wait</i> is used as the reset value when a counter reaches zero.</li>
            <li>Add new <i>qccSpeakDamaged</i> entity field, to allow for extra sounds on getting hurt. Currently used with Gordon's HEV suit.</li>
            <li>
                Add new <i>QCC_FL_FAST_MELEE</i> flag. Allows for Champion Melee Weapon attacks to be twice as fast. 
                Currently used with Gordon Freeman's crowbar and the Intruder's sickles.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Crucible and Insomnia now have map names instead of just filenames when displaying map info in-game.</li>
            <li>Re-lit Crucible and Insomnia with an extra bounce light.</li>
            <li><i>qccSpeakFrag</i> and <i>qccSpeakDamaged</i> now default to the <i>QCC_SpeakCombatNull</i> method.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Plugged a leak in Insomnia.</li>
            <li>
                <i>isHordeMode</i> global now resets state on New Game. This previously would not get reset to zero after playing a Horde Mode map 
                and then choosing to start a New Game after, resulting in unexpected behavior and crashes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="v11">Version 11.2 Hot Fix</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Updated deathmatch mode control. Now all you have to do is use the required impulse commands. 
                I may make this a menu for Remaster in the future.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Actually fixed Horde Mode weapons respawn. Turns out I was forgetting to set the "isHordeMode" variable used everywhere.</li>
            <li>Changing Deathmatch modes now disables / enables powerups depending upon whether you're entering or leaving Duel Mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Bots will attack team mates, even though they can't harm them.</li>
            <li>Big John can sometimes be unable to get out of the water in certain areas on certain maps.</li>
            <li>
                Bots playing as Big John can still get stuck in a pseudo Big Barrage state, causing them to jump in place unable to move
                after using their ability.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bounce pads can be a little finicky. To more reliably bounce on diagonal bounce pads, stop holding your movement inputs just before 
                stepping or jumping onto the bounce pad.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Version 11.1 Hot Fix</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Added "impulse 40" to help update the current deathmatch mode.</li>
            <li>Updated manual to include section on Deathmatch Modes.</li>
            <li>Bots will now choose either Red or Blue team when switching to Team Deathmatch or Capture the Flag.</li>
            <li>Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, Rocket Launcher, and Railgun pickups now only give 1 ammo if ammo is equal or more than 10.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Renamed "pak0.pak" to "pakx.pak". The pak file needs to be renamed regardless and the mod doesn't work without the other pak files.</li>
            <li>Ranger Dire Orb throw animation is significantly faster, allowing him to warp much more quickly. Should make it easier to use.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Horde Mode weapons respawn again, based on Deathmatch rules.</li>
            <li>
                Fixed Deathmatch Frag Limit bug. In Ironwail, the default Deathmatch value is 1, while in the Remaster it's 3. This was causing the 
                match to assume it was in Team Deathmatch, causing issues with proper scoring. Team Scoring has been reworked to avoid these issues and 
                Team Deathmatch is now "deathmatch 4". Both "deathmatch 1" and "deathmatch 3" correspond to Free For All / Normal Deathmatch.
            </li>
            <li>Team mates can no longer directly harm each other in team modes.</li>
            <li>Gib models now display correct skins.</li>
            <li>Ammo will no longer exceed max limits.</li>
            <li>Rocket jumping should no longer send you to the Moon.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Version 11</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Galena.</li>
            <li>New Champion: Caleb.</li>
            <li>New Map: Insomnia. Supports Deathmatch.</li>
            <li>New Music: "He Who Walks In Blood" (track31.ogg). Based off of Chris Vrenna's "Volkerh" track in Quake Champions.</li>
            <li>Added ammo types Bullets, Bolts, and Slugs. Ammo boxes not currently implemented, for now they spawn Spikes, Rockets, and Cells respectively.</li>
            <li>Added "qcc_weapon_tribolt". Not currently implemented, for now spawns a grenade launcher.</li>
            <li>Added QCC_FL_ABILITY flag. This should help aid in damage boosts for ability radius attacks against monsters, among other features.</li>
            <li>
                Added .qccSpeakSpawn, .qccSpeakFrag, .qccSpeakItem, .qccSpeakCthonGree, .qccSpeakCthonKill, .qccSpeakShubGreet, and .qccSpeakShubKill entity fields 
                to more easily facilitate "chatty" champions like Gordon Freeman.
            </li>
            <li>
                Added considerations for "Duel" Ruleset; mostly just modifies some item timing things for now. 
                You can enable Duel by setting your server's "deathmatch" variable to "2".
            </li>
            <li>Began adding "Team Deathmatch" code. Feel free to test it out by setting your server's "deathmath" variable to "3".</li>
            <lli>
                Added "trigger_heal" entity. This entity will heal 5 points of health every other second or so, up to an overstack of 175. 
                Currently implemented in the blood hall in Insomnia.
            </lli>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Cooldowns increased from 45 to 60 seconds. They now use a global cooldown constant in case it needs to be changed later. 
                Champions with shorter cooldowns (Keen, Keel) now divide against that global cooldown constant, so that they still provide the same number of uses.
            </li>
            <li>Monsters no longer provide ability cooldown if they were killed by an ability.</li>
            <li>Reduced velocity of thrown armor shards.</li>
            <li>Reduced number of armor shards thrown by enemies.</li>
            <li>Ranger Dire Orb now deals 15 touch damage (down from 50, live was 25, oops).</li>
            <li>Death Knight: Flame Strike deals extra damage against monsters, to match with other Champion offensive abilities.</li>
            <li>Death Knight ability speed increased from 300 to 666 (live was 800!).</li>
            <li>Keel: Multi-grenades deal extra damage against monsters.</li>
            <li>Slash: Plasma Trail now matches the player's skin. She still only has two skins, but hopefully we can get more in the future.</li>
            <li>Duke Nukem: Devastator now deals extra damage against monsters.</li>
            <li>Duke Nukem: Replaced all calls to Duke's voice line functions with the new .qccSpeak... fields. Duke now uses the speak fields along with Caleb.</li>
            <li>Anarki max speed reduced from 640 to 625.</li>
            <li>Anarki max inject speed reduced from 716 to 700.</li>
            <li>Scalebearer Forward Accel reduced from 500 to 450.</li>
            <li>Scalebearer Heavyweight does scaling damage based on speed to a maximum of 25 at 395 ups (prev 25 or 50 at speed thresholds).</li>
            <li>Scalebearer Bull Rush now does a flat 75 damage.</li>
            <li>Scalebearer Bull Rush damage reduction reduced from 67% to 50%.</li>
            <li>Scalebearer Bull Rush shoot delay is now set to 0.4 seconds.</li>
            <li>Slash max speed reduced from 830 to 700 (live was 750, oops!).</li>
            <li>Sorlag max speed reduced from 625 to 600.</li>
            <li>Reduced bit rate on Goroth music, cutting down file size significantly. Probably didn't need to be at 418 kbps.</li>
            <li>Separated QCC weapons into separate QC files to make them more manageable.</li>
            <li>
                Railgun ammo now uses Slugs instead of Cells. The icon will still show the Cells icon but only because the icons are hardcoded. 
                The ammo count will display correctly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shells will now also give Bullets if there are no Bullet Boxes in the map. 
                While not implemented yet, this will allow you to reload the Machine Gun in the official campaigns and multiplayer maps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rockets will now also give Bolts if there are no Bolt Boxes in the map. 
                While not implemented yet, this will allow you to reload the Tribolt in the official campaigns and multiplayer maps.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cells will now also give Slugs if there are no Slug Boxes in the map. 
                This will allow you to reload the Railgun in the official campaigns and multiplayer maps.
            </li>
            <li>Ammo and Weapon Pickup definitions moved to respective weapon QC files.</li>
            <li>Hourglass methods separated into own QC file.</li>
            <li>Light Armor and Heavy Armor methods moved to it_armor.qc.</li>
            <li>QCC_ThrowPowerup method moved to it_powerup.qc.</li>
            <li>Weapons now have respawn times based upon the server's "deathmatch" variable.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px">Deathmatch 1 and 3 are Free For All and Team Deathmatch. Weapon respawn is 1 seconds.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px">Deathmatch 2 is Duel. Weapon respawn is 5 seconds. Powerups are removed.</li>
            <li>Ammo boxes now have a 20 second respawn time in all Deathmatch modes.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rerendered Duke Nukem's "trd" line from stereo to mono. Should play properly now.</li>
            <li>Fixed broken precache of Duke "bug" line. Should play now.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="v10">Version 10.1 Hot Fix</h2>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Big John can exit the water now. The fix required making his hitbox slightly shorter, matching the same height as Scalebearer and Sorlag. 
                Removed water checks for slow champs in the QCC Pre/Post Think functions since they were meant to try to fix this issue
            </li>
            <li>Added a condition for the Big John bots that will hopefully fix their ability useage.</li>
            <li>Big John now only calls out his own name when you swap to him at the start of a match.</li>
            <li>Cleaned up Big John Big Gun view model animation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Version 10</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Keel.</li>
            <li>New Champion: Big John.</li>
            <li>New Map: Crucible. Supports Deathmatch and Horde Mode.</li>
            <li>New Impulse Command: Cycle Previous Champion.</li>
            <li>Bounce pads!</li>
            <li>
                Special Health. This item gives 25 health with the added ability to overstack. Special Health first appeared in Quake Champions 
                on the map Crucible, in the location the Power Up used to be at before it was moved to the center of the map.
            </li>
            <li>Added "qcc_prop_dynamic". Used with the various torch props.</li>
            <li>FGD updated to include the new entity classes.</li>
            <li>
                Info Intermission now takes optional "target" and "targetname" fields, which can be used to aim 
                the camera at a target and update the camera's position respectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cthon now has a "Don't freeze on pain" spawnflag. Dimension of the Machine reworked Cthon to make him killable with the Lightning Gun, 
                but it was also a heavily scripted and conditional fight (by Quake's standards) where after every third of his health was lost 
                Cthon would freeze and sink into the lava via an elevator, and would only rise again when triggered by a key collection. 
                Now if you set both his "Killable" and "Don't freeze on pain" spawnflags Cthon can just be placed in a level and murdered (still only to the Lightning Gun).
            </li>
            <li>Trigger Change Level now has a "changelevel_use" function, allowing remote level changing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Major codebase reorganization and revision. Hopefully this will allow players to be a bit more responsive (if function order even really matters, idk).</li>
            <li>Doom Slayer now only makes pain sounds when below 50 health.</li>
            <li>Duke Nukem's Devastator now deals full damage to Shamblers.</li>
            <li>
                Multi-grenades will now always shower mini-grenades. Previously they would only spawn mini-grenades after a timer, 
                and would do a simple grenade explosion on contact with a living entity. Currently used by the Boss Ogre and Keel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Multi-rockets no longer deal a random amount of bonus damage, instead doing a flat rate per rocket. 
                They're not accessible by the player, but they could be added to an enemy in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
                Self damage reduction is now controlled by the new .qccSelfDamage entity field, a float multiplier. 
                When not set by an entity it defaults to 0.5. Currently used by Ranger and Keel.
            </li>
            <li>DoE Dragon now has the rocket resistance flag instead of classname checks in damage functions.</li>
            <li>QC style Quad and Pentagram powerup now despawns if not picked up within 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Horde Mode Items no longer spawn Hourglasses. Instead they have a 1 in 6 chance of spawning a Special Health.</li>
            <li>"func_spawn" has been reworked to be more KISS compliant.</li>
            <li>SoA Gremlins limited to 25 clones in Horde Mode.</li>
            <li>Goroth's explosive attacks should no longer blow out your speakers.</li>
            <li>Increased Info Intermission camera count to 10.</li>
            <li>Cthon, Fiend, DoE Guardian (Morph) and DoE Hephaestus (lavaman) code cleaned up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                DoE Plasma Gun lightning bug fixed. Even though the Plasma Gun isn't useable for the player, 
                the Dragon's projectile attack uses the same code. Don't know if this will make it harder or easier.
            </li>
            <li>Fixed dropped powerup from killed Quad / Pent bearer not despawning after a short period.</li>
            <li>DoE Guardian (Morph) should no longer be invisible in Horde Mode.</li>
            <li>DoE Guardian should no longer perpetually scream or glow after dying.</li>
            <li>Goroth and Volkerh's FGD definitions now use the correct size.</li>
            <li>Dropped power ups should now correctly give the remaining time left while also disappearing from the map. No more powerup dupes!</li>
            <li>Protection should no longer gimp rocket jumps.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Keel and Big John head gibs don't apply the proper skin.</li>
            <li>First power up doesn't print the "Incoming" / "Spawned" messages.</li>
            <li>Crucible: Bots have difficulty navigating bounce pads and ledges and sometimes get stuck in certain areas.</li>
            <li>Crucible: Bots in Horde mode have issues recognizing locked doors.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>Added messages.fgd include from Dimension of the Machine FGD pack.</li>
            <li>Added entity model definitions to qcc.fgd.</li>

            <li>Champion state abilities (Ghost Walk, Berserk, Bull Rush) now check for the DEAD_DYING deadflag. Hopefully this will fix the frozen champion bug.</li>
            <li>Champion ability cooldown is started if player dies mid-ability.</li>
            <li>Corpse models in Dimension of the Machine maps should now display the correct animation frame.</li>
            <li>Added a check to hopefully avoid accidentally using abilities on respawn.</li>
            <li>Sorlag Air Control passive should only increase speed if already moving.</li>
            <li>Sorlag Acid Spit should no longer get stuck unmoving in the air.</li>
            <li>Intruder's Fast Fire Totem now doubles attack speed for the Nailgun and Lightning Gun.</li>
            <li>Dimension of the Machine Runes should now spawn appropriately. Accidentally forgot a ".bsp" extension in the map checks for them.</li>
            <li>Dimension of the Machine Runes can now be thrown by Intruder, just as intended John Romero intended.</li>
            <li>Skins should be selectable in coop and horde modes now. Previously they would auto-switch to Red Team.</li>
            <li>Picking up a health box while on fire or poisoned should now consume the health box even if at full health / overstacked.</li>
            <li>Pentagram of Protection now reduces damage by 67% instead of 33%, making it infinitely more useful.</li>
            <li>Changed player_run() self.walkframe check to >= 6 from == 6, just in case walkframe gets set elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Reworked Death Knight's Flamestrike animation calls. This combined with the above self.walkframe fix should get his animations playing properly finally.</li>
            <li>Implemented Shambler Lightning Arc Fix from Progs_Dump.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Running out of ammo with Commander Keen should no longer throw a runaway loop.</li>
            <li>Gremlins shouldn't be able to steal Champion Abilities. They couldn't use them anyway, but better safe than sorry.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Version 7</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Commander Keen.</li>
            <li>Added Scourge of Armagon support / requirement. Use xpax.bat for ease of copying over the required data.</li>
            <li>Added Class Speed Differences. This is the start of adding different movement options for certain champions.</li>
            <li>Added Armorshards. They get thrown by players on death in multiplayer, and by certain enemies.</li>
            <li>
                Abilities can now have a variable cost. This will allow for things like Keel having 3 grenades or Athena having 2 grapples. 
                Currently only used for Commander Keen. The 20 second Dire Orb will not be making a return, sadly.
            </li>
            <li>Horde Mode now has a 33% chance to spawn hourglasses, 50% chance to spawn Health, and ~17% chance to spawn the new Light Armor.</li>
            <li>Added Horde condition to Hourglass pickup.</li>
            <li>New console background.</li>
            <li>Added Ruby Nyx and Trans Ally Duke skins.</li>
            <li>Some gibs now have multiple skins. Currently Nyx and Commander Keen.</li>
            <li>Weapon Wheel now supports the Railgun, Laser Cannon, and Proximity Gun (Mjolnir will be added at a future date).</li>
            <li>Status Bar Ranger Face replaced with "generic" Health Symbol.</li>
            <li>FGD updated to support Scourge of Armagon, Dimension of the Machine, and new Quake Champions Classic items.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Weapons now give ammo according to current Quake Champions rules:</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">If max ammo is 25, give 10 if below 10, otherwise give 5</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">If max ammo is 150, give 100 if below 100, otherwise give 10</li>
            <li>Ammo Boxes now give ammo based upon current Quake Champions rules:</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">If max ammo is 25, give 5 for small and 10 for big</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">If max ammo is 150, give 25 for small and 50 for big</li>
            <li>Green and Yellow Armors now spawn in as Light Armors (+50). Red Armor now spawns in as Heavy Armor (+100, overstacks). Respawn times set to 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Armor now absorbs a flat 67% of damage. No more varying absorption rates.</li>
            <li>Champion Classes now affect starting and maximum armor values.</li>
            <li>Champions with a special jump ability now assign it to qccJumpFunc. This avoids a huge conditional check in the Client Jump function.</li>
            <li>Resized and tilted all champ head gibs to be more in line with the default player gib.</li>
            <li>Ending music changed to Quake Main Theme.</li>
            <li>Ranger's Dire Orb now has Quad Glow.</li>
            <li>Ranger should more consistently warp inside enemies that have been Orbed. Still needs more testing.</li>
            <li>Nyx's Ghost Walk now prevents item pickup.</li>
            <li>Nyx's Ghost Walk no longer shows Quad / Pentagram glow while active.</li>
            <li>Cthon can now be telefragged. He is still impervious to other weapons.</li>
            <li>Railgun now only replaces one Rocket Launcher if there are more than 1 in a Deathmatch map.</li>
            <li>Ability Ready sounds will now only play for the player and not the world if the engine supports "localsound". Otherwise, fall back to previous behavior.</li>
            <li>Health overstack now carries over to the next map in SP and Coop.</li>
            <li>Refactored Bot ability use code. You probably won't notice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Champions can now be selected properly after changing maps in a server.</li>
            <li>Railgun will now only replace a Rocket Launcher at the start of a map.</li>
            <li>Locked buttons now display the correct required key. Plays locked sound again.</li>
            <li>
                Weapons in multiplayer now only trigger their targets the first time they are picked up. This was a missed line when porting over MG1 QC code. 
                This should resolve the Cthon fight issues at the end of Dimension of the Machine and potentially any other coop weapon trigger issues.
            </li>
            <li>Horde mode used to not spawn rotten healths because of a missing else conditional. Fixed this after the rotten health->hourglass swap.</li>
            <li>Abilities will no longer weapon lock you when changing levels while an ability is active. Should also fix some respawn bugs, too.</li>
            <li>Connected players now increments, allowing coop item code to work.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="v6">Version 6</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: The Intruder from DUSK. Don't tell David.</li>
            <li>
                Added Champion Select Menu for Rerelease. You activate the menu the same way as cycling through champions. 
                Falls back on old behavior when using other engines. Unfortunately this is not feasible for skins, due to the number of impulse commands that would be required.
            </li>
            <li>Added Dimension of the Machine and Horde Mode support. Dimension of the Past supported by default. A batch file is included to assist with this.</li>
            <li>Added Ranger + Nyx ability telefrag messages. They don't seem to work properly yet though, I'll have to straighten that out next update.</li>
            <li>Shub Speaks! upon seeing a player.</li>
            <li>Player Gibs now have a new BodyQueue system to support the Intruder. This potentially doubles the amount of corpses in play.</li>
            <li>Added Railgun to Rerelease Weapon Wheel. Currently uses Lightning Gun icon.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Consolidated everything into the Rerelease QC files. Every sprint, bprint, and centerprint call now has backwards compatibility 
                with the old string formatting. A little painful to implement, but eases the development A LOT. Fewer QC files to maintain, 
                and adds the possibility of adding language support for Rerelease in the future more easily.
            </li>
            <li>Remapped QCC impulses due to how the Rerelease Champion Menu needed to be implemented. Be sure to update your key binds!</li>
            <li>Nyx Ghostwalk color shift is BLUE now.</li>
            <li>Doom Slayer has less blood in his eyes when going Berserk.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Skins now appropriately wrap through the individual champion's available skins. 
                Ring of Shadows and Nyx's Invis now use skin 0, then set the skin back once visible again. No more endless console complaints!
            </li>
            <li>Ranger Bots should more frequently warp to their orb if a potential enemy is close enough to it (32u).</li>
            <li>
                Duke Nukem no longer has the ability to start talking underwater. Probably. 
                If he starts talking moments before hopping into the water, he'll continue to. I'll fix that next update. Probably.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Final boss in Dimension of the Machine seems to have scripting issues when playing in Coop. This may be a wider issue for coop. Currently works in Single Player.</li>
            <li>Horde Mode Lock Buttons will print the wrong key type, but still require the correct key type.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="v5">Version 5</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                New Weapon: Railgun. Multiple DM maps either had rocket launchers replaced or a railgun added. 
                Every id1 episode has 1 railgun to find. Recommended bind: "bind r impulse 109".
            </li>
            <li>
                Added Bot Support. Bots will randomize Champion picks and skins. They will also use the new Railgun and their Abilities when they feel appropriate. 
                They may still have some bugs, but seemed to test fine as of version 5's release.
            </li>
            <li>Added alternate skins for Death Knight.</li>
            <li>Ranger and Duke Nukem now have Green Skins. Doom Slayer will retain his Green Skin when on Green Team in Team Deathmatch.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Kill command in multiplayer no longer crashes the game. The issue was the "set_suicide_frame" method checking for a specific player MDL. 
                Now it just checks if the model is the Champ Gib model.
            </li>
            <li>Current Champions should no longer exit Abilities early or get stuck in them.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <a href="#ChangeLog" target="_self">Top</a>

        <hr>

        <h2 id="v4">Version 4</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Duke Nukem.</li>
            <li>Added Ability and Melee Weapon specific kill messages.</li>
            <li>Shub now looks for players before going into standard idle. This allows player reactions upon "seeing" her.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Skins now properly change and are maintained across deaths.</li>
            <li>Weapon autoswaps, weapon + ammo pickups no longer switch away from active abilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="v3">Version 3</h2>
        <h4>Additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>New Champion: Doom Slayer.</li>
            <li>Melee Weapons now produce customizable wall hit sounds and optional enemy hit sounds</li>
            <li>Added skin support:</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">In most engines changing teams will change skins.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">In Rerelease, skins change based on teams only in team mode. In free for all modes, use "impulse 137". I bound it to K.</li>
                <li style="margin-left: 30px;">Currently utilized only by Ranger and Doom Slayer, but planning support for others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed Dire Orb speed from 500 to 620, to be roughly twice Ranger's base move speed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Fixed Wall/Double Jump Bug: in the event that a player queued up a new Champion without double jump after dying mid double jump as Nyx or Doom Slayer, 
                they were unable to jump. Now self.qccDoubleJump gets reset to 0 on respawn.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fixed Ranger Dire Orb animation bug: interrupting the Dire Orb think process could cause Ranger to be unable to act. 
                Dire Orb throw animation now utilizes standard animation function calls.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Known Issues</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Berserk ability tilts the view angle due to the way the red tint is acquired. I felt this was an acceptable tradeoff since this mod is intended to be 
                QuakeC only + re-release compatible, and color tints seem to be hardcoded to specfic scenarios.

            <li>Champion selection persists across levels (reverts to Ranger if you use the map cheat).</li>
            <li>Added Ability Ready notification + sound.</li>
            <li>Added Hourglass pickup sound, no longer uses rotten health.</li>
            <li>Changed Shub Death scene to show current champion.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Changes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Monsters no longer print the ability timer cooldowns, now only hourglasses and attempting to use the ability will.</li>
