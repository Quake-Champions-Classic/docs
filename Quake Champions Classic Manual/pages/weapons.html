        <p>
            All vanilla weapons have had some serious rebalancing to put them more in line with the balance in the official <i>Quake Champions</i>. 
            Weapon firing rates are the same as vanilla Quake 1, except where otherwise specified.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weapons added by <i>Scourge of Armagon</i> remain untouched.

        <h2>Melee</h2>
        <p>
            <img src="../images/w_axe.png" height="50px"><br>
            No longer only an axe, many Champions now wield a unique melee weapon that is all their own. 
            Most however will use the familiar Gauntlet from <i>Quake III Arena</i>. The differences are purely cosmetic in most cases.<br>

            Both shotguns have gotten a significant boost in their damage output, now being extremely useful in close range. 
            While you can still technically snipe with them, the lower ammo limits do encourage you to get up close and personal with them instead.<br>

            Nails now deal radius damage, making them more dangerous not only for your enemies but also for you. 
            More enterprising players can attempt to nail jump with the new change. The radius damage may seem high 
            but due to the way Quake measures radius distance the actual damage inflicted ends up being a little lower than direct damage.<br>

            Grenades will now deal direct damage in addition to splash damage, operating nearly identically to Rockets.

            The lightning beam bug has been fixed, so the LG will now fire only in the direction you aim. Sorry, speedrunners, 
            but there are plenty of other ways to break the game in this mod! The Lightning Gun is no longer the power house of the cell, 
            but it still remains a valuable part of a Champion's arsenal.<br>

            A new weapon added by the mod, the Railgun operates similarly to the one in <i>Quake Champions</i>. 
            The Railgun will spawn in each episode of the original campaign, as well as all of the original multiplayer maps. 
            In the event that a map has no Railgun and more than one Rocket Launcher, the second Rocket Launcher will turn into a Railgun.<br>
