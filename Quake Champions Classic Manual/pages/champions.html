            Commander Keen's trusty sidearm stuns foes in place, disrupting their ability to evade and attack for 3 seconds. 
            The Neural Stunner can be fired up to 3 times in a row on a full charge; successive shots stack the stun time. 
            Use the opportunity to follow up with a rocket or pogostick combo!

        <p>
            <b>Passive Ability : <i>Pogo Mastery</i></b><br>
            Commander Keen's melee weapon is a pogo stick he found on Mars; his unsurpassed skill with the device allows him to alter his direction of movement mid-bounce. 
            Holding jump while touching the ground will cause Keen to leap to incredible heights. Landing on an enemy will severely damage them. 
            The pogo stick can be hot swapped to by using the jump input mid-air, while using the attack input will hot swap back to the previous weapon.

            Being an 8 year old boy, Commander Keen is shorter than the other champions by a significant amount. This can make him harder to hit.

            Keel is equipped with grenade launchers which operate on a cooldown. When the multi-grenade connects with a target or after 2.5 seconds of bouncing, 
            it explodes into multiple mini-grenades. Each grenade takes 15 seconds to cooldown, and up to 3 multi-grenades can be stored for use.
