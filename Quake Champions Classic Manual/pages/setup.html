    <h1 align="center">Setup</h1>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        To play <i>Quake Champions Classic</i>, you will need to own a copy of <i>Quake 1</i> and the official Mission Packs, <i>Scourge of Armagon</i>, 
        <i>Dissolution of Eternity</i>, <i>Dimension of the Past</i>, and <i>Dimension of the Machine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mod is designed with Nightdive Remaster compatibility in mind, but is also tested on the Ironwail source port. 
        The mod <i>should</i> be mostly engine agnostic, as it is designed completely in Quake C with conditional checks in place for Remaster exclusive features.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
        For the 2021 Rerelease, extract the mod folder inside the <i>../Steam/steamapps/common/Quake/rerelease/</i> folder. For all other engines, 
        follow their mod installation instructions (typically copy the mod folder to the Quake root folder).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once extracted, run <b><i>xpax.bat</i></b> to automatically copy the data from the addons into the mod folder. For Linux users, 
        <b><i>xpax.sh</i></b> is provided thanks to a community member contribution. The Mission Packs should be installed in their default locations 
        (eg: <i>Quake Install Path\hipnotic\</i>). Once the batch file is run, the QCC folder should contain multiple pak files and a music folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        If for some reason you are unable to run either the batch or shell script and must perform the setup manually, 
        you'll need to rename <i>pak0.pak</i> to <i>pak4.pak</i>, then copy and rename the following pak files:
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        <table>
            <tr class="header">
                <td>Origin</td>
                <td>Rename</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>hipnotic/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak0.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>rogue/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak1.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dopa/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak2.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mg1/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak3.pak</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>

    <p>Once the files are copied and renamed, your QCC folder should look like this:</p>

    <p align=center><img src="../images/setup01.png" height="250px" alt="Setup Guide 2"></p>

    <p>
        If you were able to run the batch file or shell script, the music folder will have automatically copied and renamed all of the tracks. 
        If you need to do this manually, the soundtrack order is <i>Quake</i> (<i>id1</i>), <i>Scourge of Armagon</i> (<i>hipnotic</i>), 
        and <i>Dissolution of Eternity</i> (<i>rogue</i>).
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Setup</h2>
    <p>
        It is highly recommended to bind the new impulses added with the mod. Please read the <a href="impulse.html" target="main"><b>Impulses chapter</b></a> to learn more.
