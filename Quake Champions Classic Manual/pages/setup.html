    <h1 align="center">Setup</h1>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        To play <i>Quake Champions Classic</i>, you will need to own a copy of <i>Quake 1</i> and the official Mission Packs, <i>Scourge of Armagon</i>, 
        <i>Dissolution of Eternity</i>, <i>Dimension of the Past</i>, and <i>Dimension of the Machine</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The mod is designed with Nightdive Remaster compatibility in mind, but is also tested on the Ironwail source port. 
        The mod <i>should</i> be mostly engine agnostic, as it is designed completely in Quake C with conditional checks in place for Remaster exclusive features.
    </p>

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
        For the 2021 Rerelease, extract the mod folder inside the <i>../Steam/steamapps/common/Quake/rerelease/</i> folder. For all other engines, 
        follow their mod installation instructions (typically copy the mod folder to the Quake root folder).
    </p>

    <p>
        Once extracted, run <b><i>xpax.bat</i></b> to automatically copy the data from the addons into the mod folder. For Linux users, 
        <b><i>xpax.sh</i></b> is provided thanks to a community member contribution. The Mission Packs should be installed in their default locations 
        (eg: <i>Quake Install Path\hipnotic\</i>). Once the batch file is run, the QCC folder should contain multiple pak files and a music folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        If for some reason you are unable to run either the batch or shell script and must perform the setup manually, 
        you'll need to rename <i>pakx.pak</i> to <i>pak4.pak</i> and <i>paky.pak</i> to <i>pak5.pak</i>, then copy and rename the following pak files:
    </p>

    <p align="center">
        <table>
            <tr class="header">
                <td>Origin</td>
                <td>Rename</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>hipnotic/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak0.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>rogue/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak1.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>dopa/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak2.pak</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>mg1/pak0.pak</td>
                <td>pak3.pak</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </p>

    <p>Once the files are copied and renamed, your QCC folder should look like this:</p>

    <p align=center><img src="../images/setup01.png" height="250px" alt="Setup Guide 2"></p>

    <p>
        If you were able to run the batch file or shell script, the music folder will have automatically copied and renamed all of the tracks. 
        If you need to do this manually, the soundtrack order is <i>Quake</i> (<i>id1</i>), <i>Scourge of Armagon</i> (<i>hipnotic</i>), 
        and <i>Dissolution of Eternity</i> (<i>rogue</i>).
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Setup</h2>
    <p>
        It is highly recommended to bind the new impulses added with the mod. Please read the <a href="impulse.html" target="main"><b>Impulses chapter</b></a> to learn more.
    </p>

    <h2 id="UpdatingTheMod">Updating the Mod</h2>
    <p>
        Due to the way the mod is installed, it is not enough to just overwrite your old mod files with the new ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The easiest way to accomplish this is by deleting the contents of your <i><b>qcc</b></i> folder and doing a clean mod install. 
        In the Remaster this can be done without issue, but other Quake engines may keep the mod's configuration and bindings in 
        the mod folder. If you want to avoid having to reconfigure the mod after updating you'll want to perform a manual update. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To update the mod manually you'll want to not only overwrite the contents of the mod folder with the new files, 
        but you will also need to delete the last numbered pak file in your mod folder (usually <b>pak4.pak</b>). 
        Then you'll need to rename your new <b>pakx.pak</b> to the name of the pak file you just deleted. 
    </p>
