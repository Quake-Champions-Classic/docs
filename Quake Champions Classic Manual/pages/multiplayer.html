        <h2>Hosting A Match</h2>
        <p>To play multiplayer with the <b>Nightdive Remaster</b>, you'll need to follow the following steps:</p>
        <p align=center><img src="../images/multiplayer00.png" height="200px"></p>
        <p>Pick either <b>Online</b> or <b>Local Player</b>. Once you are in either menu...</p>
        <p align=center><img src="../images/multiplayer01.png" height="200px"> <img src="../images/multiplayer04.png" height="200px"></p>
        <p>... open the Console and enter the command <b>game qcc</b>.</p>
        <p align=center><img src="../images/multiplayer02.png" height="200px"></p>
        <p>If all goes well your screen should look like this:</p>
        <p align=center><img src="../images/multiplayer03.png" height="200px"> <img src="../images/multiplayer05.png" height="200px"></p>
        <p>You should be all set to change your server settings and start the match!</p>

        <p><i><b>NOTE:</b> To select a map, you'll need to choose the appropriate episode. 
            Don't worry! This will not deactivate the mod thanks to the</i> <b>mapdb.json</b> <i>configuration.</i></p>
        <p align=center><img src="../images/multiplayer06.png" height="200px"></p>

        <h2>Joining A Match</h2>
        <p>
            To join a server running <i>Quake Champions Classic</i> in the Nightdive Remaster, you need only to have the mod correctly installed. 
            Joining any server will automatically activate the mod.
        </p>
        <p>
            For other engines, follow their instructions. It is typically enough to activate the mod with the console command <b>game qcc</b> 
            and then host / join a game as normal.
        </p>

        <h2 id="DeathmatchModes">Deathmatch Modes</h2>
        <p>
            Currently implemented is an experimental Deathmatch Mode system. It's a bit hacky at the moment due to the way the Quake engine works. 
            To change Deathmatch Modes you'll use <b>impulse 4#</b>, where <b>#</b> is the deathmatch mode you wish to switch to. 
            The currently tracked modes are:
