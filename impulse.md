# <p align=center>IMPULSES</p>

## New Impulse Commands

With a new mod comes new impulse commands! If you are new to Quake Mods, you can bind each of these commands to a key using the console command `bind <input> impulse <number>`, eg: `bind r impulse 39`.<br>

| Impulse | Description | Recommended Bind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 22 | Use Champion Ability | F |
| 23 | Change Champion | H |
| 26 | Cycle Previous Champion | |
| 24 | Change Skin / Team | K |
| 25 | Interact | E |
| 29 | Observer Mode | O |
| 36 | Proximity Gun |  |
| 37 | Laser Cannon |  |
| 39 | Railgun | R |
<br>

## Champion Impulses

Additionally, each Champion is bound to an impulse as well. While it's not recommended to bind every Champion to a key, you may want to bind your favorites to get into the action right away.<br>

> _NOTE: As Champions are added these impulses are bound to change. You may need to rebind your champ shortcuts with each update._
