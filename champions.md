> **First Appearance : _Doom_**

> **Active Ability : _Berserk_**
<br>Doom Slayer explodes into a burning rage for 5 seconds, unleashing his fists on any hapless demons and champions who get in his way. Doom Slayer's movement increases and he gains a burst of speed when he punches in the air. His fists deal roughly three times their normal damage.

<br>Doom Slayer can jump while in the air once, allowing him to slow his fall and disrupt rocket predictions.

## <p align=center>Commander Keen
<p align=center><img src="images/champ_keen.png" height=120 /></p>

> **First Appearance : _Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons_**

> **Active Ability : _Neural Stunner_**
<br>Commander Keen's trusty sidearm stuns foes in place, disrupting their ability to evade and attack for 3 seconds. The Neural Stunner can be fired up to 3 times in a row on a full charge; successive shots stack the stun time. Use the opportunity to follow up with a rocket or pogostick combo!

> **Passive Ability : _Pogo Mastery_**
<br>Commander Keen's melee weapon is a pogo stick he found on Mars; his unsurpassed skill with the device allows him to alter his direction of movement mid-bounce. Holding jump while touching the ground will cause Keen to leap to incredible heights. Landing on an enemy will severely damage them. The pogo stick can be hot swapped to by using the jump input mid-air, while using the attack input will hot swap back to the previous weapon.

> **Passive Ability : _Odd One Out_**
<br>Being an 8 year old boy, Commander Keen is shorter than the other champions by a significant amount. This can make him harder to hit.

> **First Appearance : _Quake III Arena_**

> **Active Ability : _Grenade Swarm_**
<br>Keel is equipped with grenade launchers which operate on a cooldown. When the multi-grenade connects with a target or after 2.5 seconds of bouncing, it explodes into multiple mini-grenades. Each grenade takes 15 seconds to cooldown, and up to 3 grenades can be stored for use.

> **Passive Ability : _Reinforced_**
<br>Keel has 60% self damage reduction. Splash damage is reduced by 20%; this stacks with the self damage reduction.

> **Passive Ability : _Stockpile_**
<br>Keel can reduce the cooldown of his ability by 10% by collecting any ammo box.

> **First Appearance : _Quake Champions_**

> **Active Ability : _Bullrush_**

> **Passive Ability : _Acceleration_**
<br>Scalebearer will gain speed while moving in a straight line.

> **Passive Ability : _Heavyweight_**
<br>Letting his momentum carry him, Scalebearer brings the hurt simply by running into his enemies.

<br>Perform a crouch slide by holding the jump input just as you land on the ground after jumping or falling, vastly increasing Slash's movement speed.

<br>Straight out of the Pentagon's top secret labs comes this double barreled brute of a weapon which lets loose swarms of miniature stinger missiles in the direction of your enemies.

> **Passive Ability : _Jetpack_**
<br>Duke's government-issue jetpack is one of his greatest tools, whether in mortal conflict against raging aliens or in personal grudge matches in the Arena Eternal. Jump, then press and hold the jump input to fly for a brief period of time. Standing still while activating it will send Duke straight up, while moving in a direction before activation will cause Duke to fly in that direction.

> **Passive Ability : _Duke Talk_**
<br>Duke will comment on almost everything he does. This can give away your position, but your opponents might be too distracted by the quips to take advantage of this.

[Top](#champions)<br>

<p align=center><img src="images/champ_duskdude.png" height=180 /></p>

<br>This artifact doubles the Intruder's firing rate with all weapons for roughly 6 seconds.
