# <p align=center>MULTIPLAYER</p>

To play multiplayer with the **Nightdive Remaster**, you'll need to follow the following steps:

## HOST

Enter the **Multiplayer** menu. If you currently have a mod active, it will be deactivated and you'll revert to the base game.

Pick either **Online** or **Local Play**. Once you are in either menu...

... open the Console and enter the command `game qcc`.

If all goes well your screen should look like this:

You should be all set to change your server settings and start the match!<br>

_NOTE: To select a map, you'll need to choose the appropriate episode. Don't worry! This will not deactivate the mod thanks to the_ `mapdb.json` _configuration._

## CLIENT
To join a server running _Quake Champions Classic_ in the Nightdive Remaster, you need only to have the mod correctly installed. Joining any server will automatically activate the mod.<br>

For other engines, follow their instructions. It is typically enough to activate the mod with the console command `game qcc` and then host / join a game as normal.
