## <p align=center>New Items</p>

Armor has been reworked. There are no longer different classes of armor with different levels of protection. Instead we follow the Quake Champions ruleset.

### Armor Shard

### Light Armor

### Powerup
Powerups now take 90 seconds to spawn in Multiplayer, then 120 seconds to respawn.

### Quad Damage
<img src="images/quad.png" height=180 /><br>
Quad Damage will now respawn as a Pentagram after being collected if a certain spawnflag is set.

### Pentagram of Protection
<img src="images/pentagram.png" height=180 /><br>
The Pentagram no longer grants invincibility. Instead it grants an additional 67% damage reduction. The effect stacks with the damage reduction from armor and abilities. The Pentagram will also now respawn as a Quad Damage after being collected if a certain spawnflag is set.

### Megahealth
<img src="images/megahealth.png" height=180 /><br>
Still restores 100 points of health, but now can only raise health 75 points above maximum. The Megahealth now respawns every 30 seconds.

High damage hitscan sniping weapon. In Quake Champions Classic the Railgun uses up 6 cells per shot, for a total of 25 shots.<br><br>
All of the base game multiplayer maps now have support for the Railgun, so long as they possess at least 2 Rocket Launchers. If so, one of the Rocket Launchers will be replaced.<br><br>
The original campaign now features one Railgun in each Episode.
